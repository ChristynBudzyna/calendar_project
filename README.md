# calendar_project
A calendar for new plays and musicals.  An app where users can submit events to a calendar, that are then approved or rejected by an admin. It uses the cocoon gem for nested forms (adding performances), the paperclip gem for picture uploading, and the simple calendar gem for the monthly and weekly calendar layout.
